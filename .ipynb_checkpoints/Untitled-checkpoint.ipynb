    "# Testing GPT-4-Turbo generated text reading level using Flesch-Kincaid readability test\n",

    "Currently in our edtech product we use two seperate text generators for passages. One that generates a passage to use in creating resources and another levels any text input. I would like to use different measurements to check how close is the generated text by gpt-4-turbo.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach:\n",
    "1. Gather initial data(Generated texts and their structure)\n",
    "2. Score using Flesch-Kincaid method\n",
    "3. Convert score to mean of grade range\n",
    "4. Compare where the model thinks it was outputting to where it actually did according to reability score\n",
    "5. Compare if the texts that was leveled after generation improved in its score\n"

    "# What is Flesch-Kincaid \n",
    "\n",
    "The Flesch–Kincaid readability tests are readability tests designed to indicate how difficult a passage in English is to understand. There are two tests: the Flesch Reading-Ease, and the Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level. Although they use the same core measures (word length and sentence length), they have different weighting factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the two tests correlate approximately inversely: a text with a comparatively high score on the Reading Ease test should have a lower score on the Grade-Level test. Rudolf Flesch devised the Reading Ease evaluation; somewhat later, he and J. Peter Kincaid developed the Grade Level evaluation for the United States Navy.\n",
